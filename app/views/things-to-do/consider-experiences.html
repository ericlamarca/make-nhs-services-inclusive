      <h2>Ask yourself who could be excluded by your content</h2>
      <p>Some groups of people, particularly minority groups, are more likely to be excluded than others. This can be because of their age, abilities, ethnicity, a lack of resources or other circumstances.</p>
      <div class="app-example app-example--content">
        <strong class="nhsuk-tag app-example__heading">Example</strong>
        <p class="nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-0">If someone who is pregnant does not identify as a woman, they may feel excluded by breastfeeding content. We interviewed trans men who had given birth and are creating new content on chestfeeding for this audience.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>Do not make assumptions about your users</h2>
      <p>Be aware of your own biases and privilege, so that your design doesnâ€™t just reflect your own lived experiences.</p>
      <p>Carry out user research to make sure your design assumptions are correct.</p>
      <div class="app-example app-example--content">
        <strong class="nhsuk-tag app-example__heading">Example</strong>
        <p class="nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-0">Some of our pregnancy content assumed that people were happy about their pregnancy. But a pregnant 15-year-old may not have the same needs as someone who's older with a planned pregnancy. So we considered the needs of people with different feelings.</p>
