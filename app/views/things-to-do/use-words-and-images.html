      <h2>
        Make sure your images are inclusive and represent your audience
      </h2>
      <p>
        Try to include a variety of skin tones, genders, ages and body shapes. Consider the importance of the diverse images you are including and what they signify. Challenge stereotypes.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Add clear, inclusive alt text [link] for people who use screen readers or other assistive technology.
      </p>
      <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-xs">
        Example
      </h3>
      <p>
        People with black or brown skin may feel excluded if a page has multiple images of people who have white skin and no images of people like themselves. 
      </p>

      <h2>
        Make your content easy for everyone to understand
      </h2>
      <p>
        Be aware that some people with autism or other cognitive differences understand content differently. People who do not know English as a first language may also struggle with idiom.
      </p>
      <p>
        Read the <a href="">W3C summary on making content usable for people with cognitive and learning disabilities: summary</a> and the <a href="">section on clear and understandable content</a>.
      </p>
      <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-xs">
        Example
      </h3>
      <p>
        Someone may interpret “keep an eye on the rash” literally meaning they should put their eye on the rash. We reworded some content about a rash to make it clearer. 
      </p>

      <h2>
        Write for and about people in a way that is inclusive and respectful
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create your content for a variety of user groups, for example, people with a range of skin tones. Read about making content about skin symptoms more inclusive [link]. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Check with the people you’re creating content for how they want to be described. Use the inclusive language guide to avoid “othering” or alienating people by mistake. Talk directly to your user. 
      </p>

      <h2>
        Consider how to communicate risk in a supportive way
      </h2>
      <p>
        Understand how your audience feels about a topic. Consider how your content on risks and benefits could cause harm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Align your language with how your audience communicates.
      </p>
      <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-xs">
        Example
      </h3>
      <p>
        Parents of children with Down's syndrome criticised our content for its long list of problems. We worked with them and the Down's Syndrome Association to make it more supportive. We now explain in a balanced way what it's like to have Down's syndrome and we use the word "chance" rather than "risk".
